# Introduction & Installation (DATA1300)

## What is Python?
Python is a programming language.

To run Python code, the computer needs a **Python interpreter**.
The interpreter reads Python code line by line and executes it.

---

## Python versions
- Python can have different versions installed (e.g. 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- In this course we use **Python 3.13.x**
- You can check the version with:

```bash
python3 --version
or
python3.13 --version
What is pip?

pip is the package manager for Python.

It is used to install libraries (packages).

Example:
pip install requests
or
python3 -m pip install requests

⸻

What is a virtual environment (venv)?

A virtual environment (venv) is an isolated Python environment
created for one specific project.

Why we use venv:
	•	each project can have its own libraries
	•	avoids conflicts between projects
	•	best practice in Python development

👉 One project = one virtual environment

⸻

Creating a new project (step by step)

1. Create project folder (Terminal – macOS Terminal)
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
This creates a folder called .venv inside the project.

Activating the virtual environment

macOS / Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
After activation, you should see: (.venv)  at the beginning of the terminal line.
This means the virtual environment is active. 
What is bin?
	•	bin = binaries
	•	it contains executables like:
	•	python
	•	pip
	•	activate

When we run:
source .venv/bin/activate
we tell the shell to use Python from this virtual environment.

⸻

Opening the project in VS Code
⚠️ One-time setup (only once on your computer):
	•	Open VS Code
	•	Cmd + Shift + P
	•	Type: Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH
	•	Confirm

After that, code . works in the terminal, you just type: code .
VS Code: select Python interpreter

Inside VS Code:
	•	Cmd + Shift + P
	•	Python: Select Interpreter
	•	choose Python 3.x (.venv)

This connects VS Code to your virtual environment.

⸻

Creating Python files

Two options:

Option 1: in VS Code
	•	Right-click on project folder
	•	New File
	•	Name it main.py or test1.py
Option 2: in terminal
touch main.py
Running Python code

In the VS Code terminal (venv must be active):
python test1.py
Installing libraries (if needed)

Always install libraries after venv is activated:
pip install package_name
Example: pip install requests
